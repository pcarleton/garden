I got a subscription to the Economist for Christmas this year (Thanks Taylor!).  I've tried to read the whole thing cover to cover each week, but I've never been close to being up to speed (Currently a full issue plus some behind).  That goal came from this tweet:

I feel personally attacked by this marketing material.  If Bill Gates can read the Economist cover to cover while also trying to save the world from infectious diseases, how is that I'm falling a full issue behind?

I wonder if:
- I'm a slow reader
- He's skimming
- It's bending the truth for marketing.


In any event, I plan on timing myself to see how long it takes to read a full issue cover-to-cover.

Update: I did not end up timing myself to read cover to cover, but I also gave up on reading every issue cover-to-cover.  Instead, I've been hopping around to different areas I find interesting, and I've started taken written notes (more on that in a different post.)
