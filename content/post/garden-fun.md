A list of fun things I want to play around with on this:
- A favicon that has the moon but adjusts with the phase
- Similarly, but on the top of the page
- Some kind of counter that says how long its been since I posted, maybe some kind of "staleness" -- could be an encouragement to write more or an indicator that it's time to delete some things
- Generally messing with "themes" to personalize it more (there's 3 different "modes" of PaperMod)
- Trying to make the [[post title]] style links from Logseq work here
