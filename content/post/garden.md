### Gardening

I read a few posts awhile back (I'll link to them at some point, [Will Larson](https://lethain.com/exuberant-sketches/)) about a digital garden.  Something that's a little messy, your little corner of the internet.  It's not fully edited, it's not trying to be anything. 

That's something I liked.  That it's mostly for me, but I can keep iterating on it.

### Nesting

One of the things I found compelling this week was building a floorplan of the apartment I'm renting with my partner.  I used "SweetHome 3D", an open source app (after a lot of googling, and looking at pricing pages). The initial requirement was so that my partner could start strategizing for a couch purchase, and try to figure out what would fit where.  But I found myself continuing past the point that I met that requirement.  It felt like I was making a little home. 

That feeling (and the prospect of another month's ghost.org bill without having written anything in a year) is what compelled me to try out a garden.  If I could edit it more closely, and really make it my own, maybe I'd get that same "nesting" feeling I got building the floorplan.

### Evergreen notes
One idea in this same vein is the idea of collecting thoughts in a "personal wiki" and then publishing them when they've reached critical mass. I really liked [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)'s take on this.  It seemed to take this ambiguous idea of knowledge work, and put a process to it.  The idea of an "atomic note" that really captured an idea.  I liked the bit about taking a stance on an issue.  When I tried to employ it for awhile, it did result in some interesting writing.  It got a little abstract / up my own butt.

This was when I was deep in the "Roam" sense.  I actually went back and read some, and it was actually kind of interesting.

I go back and forth between wanting to have produce these magnum opus exciting pieces, and wanting just stream of consicousness dumping grounds.  The "write-only" style lends itself to a bunch of content not really worth revisiting, but also lowers the barrier to writing.

### Logseq

I've started using Logseq a lot more for work and for personal use.  It's essentially "offline Roam" which means I can use it for work and not worry about losing stuff.  The most useful thing I've found it for is keeping me to a morning routine and a wind-down routine.  I had started using my calendar to block out my day, and pull some metrics around the same time.  I initially did this at the start of the pandemic around the same time that my stress levels at work were getting pretty high.  We set a goal for engineers to spend 30% of their time recruiting, and I wanted to measure it to see if that's actually what I was doing.

I also recently read that [Tanya O'reilly does a similar thing]() (TODO), although she uses it for a TODO list.  That inspired me to do a similar thing for my personal todo list.  The best protip out of that exchange was to realize that you can right click on a calendar event to change the color.  There's something really satisfying about changing an event from red to green to mark it as done that I had been missing out on before.  Also the explicit "yes I did this" is a helpful check-in to see if the calendar matched reality.

It feels a little tedious at times, but often helps me feel like I can be on autopilot while still achieving goals.  It's not perfect, and relies on past me thinking more strategically than current me chugging a long.  But it also makes me feel like I have a couple leverage points where I can inject more thoughtful changes to things.

I keep saying that, but I don't think I've made any significant changes as a result of looking at the data.  I find value in just blocking out my day anyway so I can realistically guess what I'm going to be able to get to that day, but I sometimes wonder if all the overhead means my net output is lower.
