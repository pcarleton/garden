I used “SweetHome 3D”, an open source app (after a lot of googling, and looking at pricing pages). The initial requirement was so that my partner could start strategizing for a couch purchase, and try to figure out what would fit where. But I found myself continuing past the point that I met that requirement. It felt like I was making a little home.\nThat feeling (and the prospect of another month’s ghost.org bill without having written anything in a year) is what compelled me to try out a garden. If I could edit it more closely, and really make it my own, maybe I’d get that same “nesting” feeling I got building the floorplan.\nEvergreen notes One idea in this same vein is the idea of collecting thoughts in a “personal wiki” and then publishing them when they’ve reached critical mass. I really liked Andy Matuschak’s take on this. It seemed to take this ambiguous idea of knowledge work, and put a process to it. The idea of an “atomic note” that really captured an idea. I liked the bit about taking a stance on an issue. When I tried to employ it for awhile, it did result in some interesting writing. It got a little abstract / up my own butt.\nThis was when I was deep in the “Roam” sense. I actually went back and read some, and it was actually kind of interesting.\nI go back and forth between wanting to have produce these magnum opus exciting pieces, and wanting just stream of consicousness dumping grounds. The “write-only” style lends itself to a bunch of content not really worth revisiting, but also lowers the barrier to writing.\nLogseq I’ve started using Logseq a lot more for work and for personal use. It’s essentially “offline Roam” which means I can use it for work and not worry about losing stuff. The most useful thing I’ve found it for is keeping me to a morning routine and a wind-down routine. I had started using my calendar to block out my day, and pull some metrics around the same time. I initially did this at the start of the pandemic around the same time that my stress levels at work were getting pretty high. We set a goal for engineers to spend 30% of their time recruiting, and I wanted to measure it to see if that’s actually what I was doing.\nI also recently read that Tanya O’reilly does a similar thing (TODO), although she uses it for a TODO list. That inspired me to do a similar thing for my personal todo list. The best protip out of that exchange was to realize that you can right click on a calendar event to change the color. There’s something really satisfying about changing an event from red to green to mark it as done that I had been missing out on before. Also the explicit “yes I did this” is a helpful check-in to see if the calendar matched reality.\nIt feels a little tedious at times, but often helps me feel like I can be on autopilot while still achieving goals. It’s not perfect, and relies on past me thinking more strategically than current me chugging a long. But it also makes me feel like I have a couple leverage points where I can inject more thoughtful changes to things.\nI keep saying that, but I don’t think I’ve made any significant changes as a result of looking at the data. I find value in just blocking out my day anyway so I can realistically guess what I’m going to be able to get to that day, but I sometimes wonder if all the overhead means my net output is lower.\n",
