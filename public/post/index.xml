      <description>I want to build my site on commit, here&amp;rsquo;s what I tried first:
set -eux rm -rf public hugo git add public echo &amp;quot;updated build directory&amp;quot; This worked! But it took some fiddling because I mistakenly set the date of this post in the future. Apparently you can do that and Hugo won&amp;rsquo;t add the pages for it, so it was running the build command but not actually updating anything.</description>

      <description>Switching ports fixed a connection problem for some reason&amp;hellip;
  the default one through sudo apt-get install hugo was from 2020, so intalled from source instead.
  Render: doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be picking up my commits as pulls.
 Just kidding it worked this time.    All my links are to &amp;ldquo;example.com&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; uhoh. Maybe I need to re-install the theme?
 Problem was the &amp;ldquo;baseUrl&amp;rdquo; in the config.</description>

      <description>A list of fun things I want to play around with on this:
 A favicon that has the moon but adjusts with the phase Similarly, but on the top of the page Some kind of counter that says how long its been since I posted, maybe some kind of &amp;ldquo;staleness&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; could be an encouragement to write more or an indicator that it&amp;rsquo;s time to delete some things Generally messing with &amp;ldquo;themes&amp;rdquo; to personalize it more (there&amp;rsquo;s 3 different &amp;ldquo;modes&amp;rdquo; of PaperMod) Trying to make the [[post title]] style links from Logseq work here  Emoji favicon https://css-tricks.</description>

      <description>I got a subscription to the Economist for Christmas this year (Thanks Taylor!). I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to read the whole thing cover to cover each week, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never been close to being up to speed (Currently a full issue plus some behind). That goal came from this tweet:
I read @TheEconomist cover-to-cover because its content makes me think critically about the world. Its editors recently asked me a tough question: What is the one thing you&amp;#39;d do to create a more open world?</description>

      <description>Render.com Register (with Github) a. (Act on your behalf): looks like it will only be able to do that on resources I grant the app access to New Static Site Push this thing to Github a. looks like it needs to be public, but I guess that&amp;rsquo;s the point anyway i. This got me thinking about how my github might actually get more traffic from people I know versus my blog which is exclusively strangers afaict.</description>

      <description>Gardening I read a few posts awhile back (I&amp;rsquo;ll link to them at some point, Will Larson) about a digital garden. Something that&amp;rsquo;s a little messy, your little corner of the internet. It&amp;rsquo;s not fully edited, it&amp;rsquo;s not trying to be anything.
That&amp;rsquo;s something I liked. That it&amp;rsquo;s mostly for me, but I can keep iterating on it.

Nesting One of the things I found compelling this week was building a floorplan of the apartment I&amp;rsquo;m renting with my partner.</description>
